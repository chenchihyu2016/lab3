How to compile?
	please type make, for I have written a makefile already.
How to run?
	please type ./lab3
The result of Question B?
	The following is the result. Of course, I append some extra code.

	chenchihyu@chenchihyu-VirtualBox:~/test$ ./tester
	Current Test Size : 1000
		sort(): 0.000182 seconds
 		v1/v2 are different.
 		insertion_sort(): 0.009031 seconds
 		v1/v2 are the same.
	Current Test Size : 10000
 		sort(): 0.002265 seconds
 		v1/v2 are different.
 		insertion_sort(): 1.06866 seconds
 		v1/v2 are the same.
	Current Test Size : 100000
 		sort(): 0.048653 seconds
 		v1/v2 are different.
 		insertion_sort(): 97.7369 seconds
 		v1/v2 are the same.
	Current Test Size : 1000000
 		sort(): 0.380051 seconds
 		v1/v2 are different.
 		insertion_sort(): 9939.23 seconds
 		v1/v2 are the same.

	The difference between the compleity of O(nlogn) and O(n^2) is obvious.
	The larger the size is, the more time will insertion sort( O(n^2) ) take.
